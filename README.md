# student-projects

If you have a problem you'd like to try and solve through the student projects, create an issue on this repo for people to check out :eyes:

## Guidelines:

* FAC's tagline is: "Create software that makes the world a better place." and the problems you want to solve should be aligned with this. üå∏‚úåÔ∏è

* We're starting from **problems**, not solutions. Of course, you will have some thoughts about how you might solve the problem, and it's OK to describe some possibilities, but you definitely shouldn't be wedded to them. In design week, you'll start from the beginning and might end up with a completely different product - all part of the fun! :smiley:

* The person who creates the issue doesn't **have** to work on the project, but if they want to then they won't have to 'compete' for it.

* You can create more than one issue (although obviously you won't be able to work on them all!).

* Feel free to leave comments on the issues with your questions. 

* For the first project, we recommend sticking with and consolidating your knowledge of the technologies that you've learnt so far in the course. ü§ì
